# Onchain Package

## Getting Started

To get started with the `onchain` package, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
2. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.
3. Run `npm init` to create a `package.json` file. Follow the prompts to set up your package.
4. Add the necessary dependencies and devDependencies to your `package.json` file.
5. Create the necessary files and directories for your project.

Here is a basic example of what your `package.json` file might look like:

```json
{
  "name": "onchain",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "A package for onchain utilities",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "some-dependency": "^1.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "some-dev-dependency": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```

You can then create your main file, for example, `index.js`, and start adding your code.

For more detailed instructions, you can refer to the `framegear/package.json` file in this repository as an example.
